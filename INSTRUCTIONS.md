### Demo considerations

1. For demo puposes I am setting just one Property. All the applications will be for PropertyId = 1.

2. For the search I am assuming that the user is in the Property Ui that list all the applications. The user will be able to type a word and the search will fetch all the applications that match this input text. 

3. Import the postman collection and the environment variables to test the endpoints
